#! /bin/bash

# This is a simple wrapper to let program use either python2 or python3.
# The choice is made based on the value of the PYTHON_VERSION environment variable.
#
# Usage:
# Given two programs that both use /usr/bin/python as their python interpreter, but they require
# different python version to work. One could either change the code of those programs (difficult),
# or change the symlink /usr/bin/python befor calling each of these programs (cumbersome), or use
# this script in place of /usr/bin/python, than add two wrapper scripts, prog1 and prog2, containing only
# #!/bin/bash
# export PYTHON_VERSION=X
# exec programX
# Than calling prog1 starts program1 and when it calls /usr/bin/python, the correct python version is
# selected.
