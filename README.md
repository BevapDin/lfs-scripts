lfs-scripts
===========

Some stuff that is/was repeatedly useful for creating and maintaining an LFS system.

- TPKGS ... a user based package manager - an "advanced" wrapper around the scripts from [More Control and Package Management using Package Users] (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/more_control_and_pkg_man.txt)
- cfgc ... a generic wrapper around `./configure && make && make install`
- some more scripts for installing and updating packages
- some standard default configuration files
